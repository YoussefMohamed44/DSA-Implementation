# DSA‑Implementation

A collection of core Data Structures and Algorithms implemented from scratch in C++.  
Used for education, practice, and building other projects relying on data structures.  

## 🔹 Contents

- Stack  
- Queue  
- Linked List (singly, doubly)  
- Trees (e.g. binary tree, BST)  
- Graphs (adjacency list / matrix, traversal algorithms)  
- Other fundamental DS / common algorithms  

## ✅ Purpose

- To provide clean, reusable implementations of core data structures and algorithms.  
- To strengthen understanding of memory management, pointers, and algorithmic fundamentals.  
- To facilitate building more complex projects (e.g. banking system, to-do list, other C++‑based systems) using tested DSA components.  

## 💻 Usage / How to compile & run

```bash
# Example (if using g++)
g++ -std=c++17 your_file.cpp -o output
./output
